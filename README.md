A native Microsoft SQL Server (TDS) client for Rust.

### Goals

- A perfect implementation of the TDS protocol.
- Asynchronous network IO.
- Independent of the network protocol.
- Support for latest versions of Linux, Windows and macOS.

### Non-goals

- Connection pooling (use [bb8](https://crates.io/crates/bb8), [mobc](https://crates.io/crates/mobc), [deadpool](https://crates.io/crates/deadpool) or any of the other asynchronous connection pools)
- Query building
- Object-relational mapping

### Supported protocols

Tiberius does not rely on any protocol when connecting to an SQL Server instance. Instead the `Client` takes a socket that implements the `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` traits from the [futures-rs](https://crates.io/crates/futures) crate.

Currently there are good async implementations for TCP in the [async-std](https://crates.io/crates/async-std), [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) and [Smol](https://crates.io/crates/smol) projects. To be able to use them together with Tiberius on Windows platforms with SQL Server, TCP protocol should be enabled in the [server settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh231672(v=sql.110).aspx) (disabled by default). In the offficial [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server) TCP is is enabled by default.

Named pipes should work by using the [NamedPipeClient](https://docs.rs/tokio/1.9.0/tokio/net/windows/named_pipe/struct.NamedPipeClient.html) from the latest Tokio versions.

The shared memory protocol is not documented and seems there are no Rust crates implementing it.

### Encryption (TLS/SSL)

Tiberius can be set to use two different implementations of TLS connection encryption. By default it uses `native-tls`, linking to the TLS library provided by the operating system. This is a good practice and in case of security vulnerabilities, upgrading the system libraries fixes the vulnerability in Tiberius without a recompilation. On Linux we link against OpenSSL, on Windows against schannel and on macOS against Security Framework.

Alternatively one can use the `rustls` feature flag to use the Rust native TLS implementation. This way there are no dynamic dependencies to the system. This might be useful in certain installations, but requires a rebuild to update to a new TLS version. For some reasons the Security Framework on macOS does not work with SQL Server TLS settings, and on Apple platforms if needing TLS it is recommended to use `rustls` instead of `native-tls`.

The crate can also be compiled without TLS support, but not with both features enabled at the same time.

Tiberius has three runtime encryption settings:

| Encryption level | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Required`       | All traffic is encrypted. (default)              |
| `Off`            | Only the login procedure is encrypted.           |
| `NotSupported`   | None of the traffic is encrypted.                |

The encryption levels can be set when connecting to the database.

### Integrated Authentication (TrustedConnection) on \*nix

With the `integrated-auth-gssapi` feature enabled, the crate requires the GSSAPI/Kerberos libraries/headers installed:
  * [CentOS](https://pkgs.org/download/krb5-devel)
  * [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/krb5/)
  * [Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/krb5) (you need the -dev packages to build)
  * [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic-updates/libkrb5-dev)
  * NixOS: Run `nix-shell shell.nix` on the repository root.
  * Mac: as of version `0.4.2` the [libgssapi](https://crates.io/crates/libgssapi) crate used for this feature now uses Apple's [GSS Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gss?language=objc) which ships with MacOS 10.14+.

Additionally, your runtime system will need to be trusted by and configured for the Active Directory domain your SQL Server is part of. In particular, you'll need to be able to get a valid TGT for your identity, via `kinit` or a keytab. This setup varies by environment and OS, but your friendly network/system administrator should be able to help figure out the specifics.

## Redirects

With certain Azure firewall settings, a login might return `Error::Routing { host, port }`. This means the user must create a new `TcpStream` to the given address, and connect again.

A simple connection procedure would then be:

```rust
use tiberius::{Client, Config, AuthMethod, error::Error};
use tokio_util::compat::TokioAsyncWriteCompatExt;
use tokio::net::TcpStream;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut config = Config::new();

    config.host("0.0.0.0");
    config.port(1433);
    config.authentication(AuthMethod::sql_server("SA", "<Mys3cureP4ssW0rD>"));

    let tcp = TcpStream::connect(config.get_addr()).await?;
    tcp.set_nodelay(true)?;

    let client = match Client::connect(config, tcp.compat_write()).await {
        // Connection successful.
        Ok(client) => client,
        // The server wants us to redirect to a different address
        Err(Error::Routing { host, port }) => {
            let mut config = Config::new();

            config.host(&host);
            config.port(port);
            config.authentication(AuthMethod::sql_server("SA", "<Mys3cureP4ssW0rD>"));

            let tcp = TcpStream::connect(config.get_addr()).await?;
            tcp.set_nodelay(true)?;

            // we should not have more than one redirect, so we'll short-circuit here.
            Client::connect(config, tcp.compat_write()).await?
        }
        Err(e) => Err(e)?,
    };

    Ok(())
}
```
