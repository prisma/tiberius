# Changes

## Version 0.5.13

- Add Config parsing for "Integrated Security" (two words)
- Unified bitflag setup
- Correct default ports
- Update to enumflags2 0.7

## Version 0.5.12

- Warnings should not affect metadata fetching (#139)

## Version 0.5.11

- Fixing of all clippy warnings. This might have some performance benefits and
might also fix some weird bugs in environments where we can't guarantee the
evaluation order. (#136)
- Add info of LCID and sort id to colation errors (#138)

## Version 0.5.10

- Remove a rogue `dbg!`

## Version 0.5.9

- Set the `app_name` in LOGIN7 to `tiberius`. This allows connecting to servers
  that expect the value to not be empty (see issue #127).

## Version 0.5.8

- Try out all resolved IP addresses (#124)

## Version 0.5.7

- Set server name in the login packet (#122)

## Version 0.5.6

-  Fix for handling nullable values (#119 #121)

## Version 0.5.5 and 0.4.21

Catastropichal build failures with feature flags fixed.

## Version 0.5.4 and 0.4.20

Removed the tls feature flag to simplify dependencies. This means you will
always get a TLS-enabled build, and can disable it on runtime. This also means
we don't always compile async-std if wanting to use tokio, and so forth.

Fixes certain issues with vendored OpenSSL on macOS platforms too.

## Version 0.5.3

Changed futures-codec2 to asynchronous-codec, due to former was yanked.

## Versions 0.5.2 and 0.4.19

Introducing working TLS support on macOS platforms.
