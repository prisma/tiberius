## Version 0.6.3

- Bignum/bigint compilation problems fixed.

## Version 0.6.2

## Version 0.6.1

## Version 0.6.0

## Version 0.5.10

- Remove a rogue `dbg!`

## Version 0.5.7

- Set server name in the login packet (#122)

## Version 0.5.5 and 0.4.21

Catastropichal build failures with feature flags fixed.

## Version 0.5.4 and 0.4.20

Removed the tls feature flag to simplify dependencies. This means you will
always get a TLS-enabled build, and can disable it on runtime. This also means
we don't always compile async-std if wanting to use tokio, and so forth.

Fixes certain issues with vendored OpenSSL on macOS platforms too.

## Version 0.5.3

Changed futures-codec2 to asynchronous-codec, due to former was yanked.

## Versions 0.5.2 and 0.4.19

Introducing working TLS support on macOS platforms.
